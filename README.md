# Portfolio

My personal portfolio website for showcasing my resume, projects, and blog posts. The site is built using SvelteKit and styled with Pico CSS.

The featured GitHub projects are dynamically retrieved through the power of the [GitHub GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql). The blog posts are seamlessly pulled in using the [Dev.to API](https://docs.dev.to/api). Additionally, I've implemented the new [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) feature to enhance the user experience.
